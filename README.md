The user should interact with this game similarly to hang man but without knowing where the letters are in the word. They should first enter how many players are in the game. Then they will gain information on how many letters there are in the word. After that if there are multiple players they will alternate. If there is only one then it will be just them. They will first choose if they are guessing a letter or a word by typing it in. Then they have an unlimited number of letter guesses but not word guesses. They only have at the most 3 word guesses. The words in the word bank are from the game ‘dominion’ which I as the creator used to play a lot. I gained some help from this website (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-word-guessing-game/) to start off my project, but it quickly changed into something different.
